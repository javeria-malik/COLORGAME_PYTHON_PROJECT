# COLORGAME_PYTHON_PROJECT
This project is a simple color recognition game built using the tkinter module in Python. The objective of the game is to type the color of the displayed text, rather than the actual text itself. The game provides a countdown timer of 30 seconds, and the player's score increases for each correct color identified within the given time limit..
